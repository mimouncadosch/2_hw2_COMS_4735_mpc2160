Make a function:
similarities(type_of_similarity, b, r)

type_of_similarity = C, T, or S
r only matters when M
b matters for all

Create two groups:
text = [1,2,...]
smooth = [17,19,...]

compute total similarity for i in text and j in text
compute total similarity for i in smooth and j in smooth
compute total similarity for i in text and j in smooth

find b that minimizes text, text and smooth, smooth
... and maximizes text smooth
